👋 Hi, I’m @TheTechProPrincess

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a tech enthusiast with certifications in CompTIA Security+ and TCM The Definitive GRC Master Class. I have a passion for IT solutions, cybersecurity, and making systems 
smarter and more secure. Whether it’s troubleshooting IT issues, setting up networks, or experimenting with cybersecurity tools, 
I’m always eager to learn and grow.

🌟 About Me

	•	💻 IT & Cybersecurity Hybrid: Combining IT expertise with a growing focus on cybersecurity to build secure, efficient systems.
	•	🧑🏾‍🎓 Computer Science Student: Pursuing a Bachelor’s in Computer Science at Texas Southern University.
	•	🛠️ Problem-Solver: I thrive on tackling technical challenges, from troubleshooting hardware to deploying honeypots and securing networks.
 

🔧 Skills & Tools

	•	User account management, help desk, troubleshooting, and system setup.
	•	IT Support (Help Desk Support).
	•	Cybersecurity Tools:
	•	TCM GRC Master Class Course, TryHackMe Labs, Honeypots, and threat detection tools.
	•	Programming: Python

🛠️ Current Projects

	•	User Account Setup: I’ve developed a streamlined process for setting up user accounts across various systems, ensuring that each account is configured with the correct permissions and access levels based on the user’s role.
	•	Business Continuity Plan (BCP): I worked on creating a Business Continuity Plan to ensure that essential systems and data are backed up and can be quickly restored in case of unexpected IT disruptions. This plan is designed to minimize downtime and keep operations running smoothly.
	•	Incident Response Plan: I’ve created an Incident Response Plan that outlines the steps IT teams should take to detect, assess, and respond to security incidents. The goal is to minimize potential damage and ensure a quick, effective recovery.
	•	Active Directory User Management Script: Using PowerShell, I wrote a script that automates the process of managing user accounts in Active Directory—whether it’s creating, modifying, or deleting users. This helps save time and reduces errors when managing multiple users in an organization.
	•	Onboarding and Offboarding Automation: I’ve automated the process of onboarding new employees and offboarding those leaving the company. This ensures that new hires get the proper access and training, while departing employees have their accounts securely deactivated.
